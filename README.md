### 1. **Project Setup**

- **Backend:**
    1. **Initialize the Backend:** Start by creating a new Node.js project using `npm init` and installing the necessary packages like `express`, `sqlite3`, `body-parser`, and `cors`.
    2. **Set up Express.js:** Create an Express.js server to handle API requests. Use `express.Router()` to organize routes.
    3. **Database Setup:** Use SQLite for the database. Create a `database.js` file to manage the SQLite connection and ensure you have tables set up for your blog posts.
    4. **API Endpoints:** Implement the required CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations:
        - **GET /posts**: Fetch all posts.
        - **GET /posts/:id**: Fetch a specific post by ID.
        - **POST /posts**: Create a new post.
        - **PUT /posts/:id**: Update a post by ID.
        - **DELETE /posts/:id**: Delete a post by ID.
    5. **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for scenarios like missing posts, validation errors, etc.
- **Frontend:**
    1. **Initialize React Project:** Create a new React project using `create-react-app` and set it up with class components.
    2. **Component Structure:**
        - **App.js:** This will serve as the main component, managing routing between the list view and detail view.
        - **Header/Footer Components:** Simple components for the layout.
        - **PostList Component:** Displays the list of blog posts, fetching data from the `/posts` endpoint.
        - **PostDetail Component:** Shows the details of a single post, fetching data from `/posts/:id`.
        - **PostForm Component:** A form for creating and editing posts, interacting with the `POST` and `PUT` endpoints.
    3. **State Management:** Use React's state to manage form inputs, loading states, and the list of posts. For class components, you can use `this.setState` to update the state.
    4. **Client-side Validation:** Implement basic validation in the form to ensure that all fields are filled out correctly before submission.

### 2. **Connecting Frontend and Backend**

- **API Integration:** Use `fetch` or `axios` in your React components to make HTTP requests to your Express.js backend.
- **Handling Responses:** Ensure you handle loading states and display errors to users if the API request fails.

### 3. **Deployment**

- **Deploy the Backend:**
    - Choose a cloud platform like Heroku or Render to deploy your Express.js server. Push your code to GitHub and connect it with the platform for deployment.
- **Deploy the Frontend:**
    - Use a service like Netlify or Vercel to deploy your React frontend. Make sure it connects correctly to your deployed backend.
- **Document Deployment:** Provide clear instructions in your README file on how to access the deployed application, including any setup needed to run it locally.

### 4. **Bonus Features (Optional)**

- **Design and Authentication:** Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for styling. For authentication, you could implement a basic login system with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- **Comments and Search:** Add a comment system to posts and a search feature that filters posts by title or content.
- **Testing and CI/CD:** Write unit tests for both frontend and backend and set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or another tool.

### 5. **Version Control and Documentation**

- Use Git for version control, creating meaningful commits as you progress.
- Write clear and concise documentation in your repository to guide users on how to set up and use your application.
